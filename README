tp_battery

A small battery indicator for use in text- based status bars. (Like in WMII.)

Sample usage:
	tp_battery `cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/energy_now` `cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/energy_full` `cat /sys/class/power_supply/AC/online`

Per default, tp_battery will display something like this:
	+36% [####      ]
'+'         AC is connected
'36%'       Battery status
'[##    ]'  Battery status bar

Configuration:

Because of the small size of tp_battery, it isn't using any configuration file. You can configure tp_battery to fit your needs right in the tp_battery.c source file.
